I am a first year PhD student at Washington University in Saint Louis. During my
undergraduate degree I had lots of space to write. While I love spending my days
thinking about sheaves, analytic functions, and cohomology, I wanted a place to
get the thoughts out of my head and onto a page.
</p>


If all goes well, there should be a post here every Sunday on whatever thoughts
have wedged themselves into the caffeine-addled brain of a graduate student
preparing for qualifying exams. I tend to think about memory, narrative, beauty,
among other things, but the last thing I want to do is put my work here in a
box. I make no promises about the quality of the posts here---this is a space
primarily for me to process my own thoughts---but if you're interested in what I
have to say, please follow along!

This is the first part in a three part series about narrative---while I would love to
write one long piece with all of the ideas, the outline became too sprawling to
write in one week. I make no claims of expertise, these are just the thought of
one mathematician with a heart for the liberal arts. Part one discusses my own
relationship to storytelling
and contains mild spoilers for /Everything Everywhere All At Once/.

-----

When I was 13 my grandfather and I went to Australia. Our group spent a few days
on K'gari (also known as Fraser Island)---our guide was an aboriginal man who's
family had lived on the island for generations. All of the electricity on
K'gari Island turns off at shortly after sunset, so light pollution is virtually
nonexistent at night. On the last night we spent on
K'gari, we sat around a fire and he told us stories from their mythology:
their creation narrative, their historical heroes, and the history and myths
of the didgeridoo. Like many civilization's, there were stories about the figures
they found in the constellations. On K'gari, however, there are portions of the
sky that are so dense with stars that the locals would create constellations out
of the negative space in the sky. I remember being fascinated by the stories. At
one point I stepped away from the fire and laid on the ground to get a better
look at the stars. I can't claim that I was somehow sucked into the
narrative and saw the heroes dancing among the stars, /but there is something magical about storytelling./

*** The Human Experience
I'm not going to pretend that I have some sort of "extra-special knowledge" when
it comes to the history of storytelling, but I do know this: storytelling is
central to the human experience. I can't cite a study but I know deep in my
bones---the same way I know how to raise my arm or know what an apple looks
like---that humans have always been telling stories. Storytelling, of course,
serves an evolutionary purpose, stories can be used to spread life-saving
information through a population group. To reduce storytelling to an
evolutionary mechanism, however, is like reducing man to a featherless biped.
When someone tells you a story, they invite you to share an experience. It's
something that humans have done for millennia: gather around the campfire and
weave epic tales of good and evil---or sometimes the epic tale of what they did
that day.

It's partially this communal aspect that draws me to narrative. In the summer of
2018 I was killing some time in a mall with a friend. We dropped by the attachde
movie theaters and saw that they were playing /Hereditary/. We knew exactly two
things about /Hereditary/: critics we trusted gave it glowing reviews and we were
pretty sure that is was horror. While /Hereditary/ isn't everyone's cup of tea
(eveen among fans of horror), we sat there transfixed as the entire crowd was
drawn in to the narrative.

I've seen /Everything Everywhere All At Once/ in theaters three times. The
pivotal "Rock" scene (arguably the thematic crux of the entire movie) is
entirely silent and is a conversation between two rocks. All of the "dialogue"
is simply written on the screen in contrasting colors so the audience can tell
which speech corresponds which rock. In a crowded theater, any moment of silence
is a risk; the sounds of people
shifting in their seats or hands rusting in a bucket of popcorn can pull me out
of the narrative and back into the dimly-lit room and almost-comfortable chair.
The rock scene in  /Everything Everywhere/, however, was different.
Complete silence gripped the theater and was only broken by the occasional
collective chuckle. While it serves as an excellent case study in the collective
nature of storytelling, I won't dwell on /Everything
Everywhere/---perhaps it will be the subject of a future post.

**** A Historical Perspective
In the beginning of undergrad I spent so much time waxing poetic about the
importance of narrative that in my second year I decided to write a paper about
it. Titled "Dress Like It's Fall and It Will Become Fall," it explored the ways
in which a society is shaped by it's cultural mythos. I won't get into the
details of the full argument, the central idea is that the stories we tell
ourselves shape the way we see the world. While it may be blatant propaganda,
Virgil's /Aeneid/ tells us what it meant to be a "good roman" in the early Roman
Empire. Its particular picture of piety tied together filial, religious, and
patriotic devotion.
The epic's hero, Aeneas (who founds modern Rome in the final chapter) has many
not-so-subtle parallels to the then newly crowned Augustus; Virgil seems to be
telling us "You know how we all revere Aeneas for his piety? We should do the
same thing with Augustus. After all, just like Aeneas was the last hope for
Troy after the city's fall Augustus has saved us from the turmoil of the past
decades."
For generations after its composure, Romans looked to /The Aeneid/ for
guidance---over two thousand year later we still read it to gain insight into the
Roman mind.

/The Aeneid/ is not a one off example! In fact, is isn't even confined to epic
poetry. I won't go so far as to say that /every/ narrative has some "deeper
meaning" that it is trying convey,[fn:1] but for the vast majority of stories, it's
safe to assume they have something to teach you. Whether or not the things they
have to say are worth listening to, however, is another question entirely.
This link between thematic ideas and narrative is why I'm such a big proponent
of the Liberal Arts. When done right, it exposes us to some of the best pieces
of literature and teaches us to engage critically with the world around us.

After my sophomore year, I had solidified many of my thoughts surrounding
storytelling. I knew that my thoughts on storytelling would likely never stop
but at least I had formalized my opinion on the place of a cultural mythos in society.

*** Compulsive Storytelling
With my grandiose views what stories "mean," its no surprise that I love telling
stories. I'm not sure if I'm any good at it,[fn:2] but I definitely have lots of
practice. Storytelling is so woven into my being that I realized that I tell
stories compulsively /while telling a story/.

Some coworkers and I were grabbing a coffee and pastries between setups during
Family Weekend. I started telling a story (sadly I can't remember what it was)
and one of the trainees stopped me.

"Wait," he said. "Does this have anything to
do with what we were talking before or are you changing the subject?"
I was a little embarrassed---I knew the relevance was tangential at best but it
stung to have that pointed out before the story was halfway done.

Thankfully, another coworker jumped to my rescue. "Don't worry," he said. "Lucas
has this super power where he starts a story that seems completely random but he
somehow always connects it back."

While what he said was kind, it set the bar of relevance a little too high for
what my story could deliver. Thankfully, he had given me another way out. "I
have this weird thing with storytelling," I said. "When I think of a story that
is related to a topic it bounces around my head until I let it our by telling
the story."
This seemed to satiate my coworkers and we went back to discussing the next room
setup: what gear we needed to pick up, how fast the turn around was, etc. In
the back of my mind, however, I was turning over what I had just said.

You see, I
spent years justifying to myself why I didn't have OCD; I had all sorts of
rationalizations for why my experience was distinct. When I read /Turtles All
the Way Down/, a book which is, in part, about the author's experience of
OCD, I told a friend "I've never seen my own experience of mental illness so
thoroughly explored... but that's weird because I don't have OCD." During an
intake exam at a new therapist a few months later, I told the examiner "I have
obsessive thought patterns, but not in an OCD way because there aren't any
compulsions that go along with them."

After years of rationalization, there I was: seated outside a coffee shop with
my coworkers having described an obsessive thought pattern and a corresponding
compulsion.

This realization put my love of storytelling in context. It's not just that I
love storytelling in the abstract and liked to take on the mantle of
storytelling from time to time---I have no choice to be a storyteller. As far as
my compulsions go, it's one of the harmless ones. With some therapy, I'm able
keep the stories in my head when the situation isn't appropriate. But at the end
of the day, I /like/ telling stories. I like what stories mean; how they bring
people together and draw them into community.

It turns out, however, that even this context was incomplete. For the final
piece, however, we need to change the subject---but I promise that it will relate.

*** The Apple

I want you to look at the nearest flat surface and imagine an apple. Not some
platonic ideal of an apple, but pretend there is a real apple sitting there.
What color is it? Does it have bruise? Is there a perfect little leaf on the
stem?
Now that you've got the picture in your mind, how would you rate your ability to
"see" the apple an a scale of 1-10 where 10 is "I know its made up, but I can practically see it"
and a 1 being "what are you even talking about, of course I can't see anything"?[fn:3]

Most of the people I ask give an answer above 6 or 7; on a good day I'm a 1.
I have a condition known as aphantasia which is sometimes colloquially known as
/mind blindness/. Put simply, there are no pictures in my head.
According to a recent study in the journal of Consciousness and
Cognition,[fn:4] less than 1% of the population has full aphantasia and about 4%
has dim/vague mental imagery (if any at all).

There are some reports of so called /acquired/ aphantasia (usually the result of
some sort of traumatic brain injury) but mine is congenital---I've had it my
whole life and never known anything else. Until November 2018 (just over a year
after the coffee shop story) I had no idea that I was different. When people
would say "picture a beach" I always thought was a way to say
"think about the ideas of peace and serenity." I figured it, like the piety of
Aeneas, was societal shorthand for a shared concept. Imagine my surprise, then,
when I learned that other people could just "see things" in their head!

Suppose I were to ask you to complete the lyrics, "Mary had a____________." Now
chances are, you were able to fill in /little lamb/ with thinking about it. It's
not like you had to picture Mary in a their shepherd's outfit or imagine a sheet
of paper with the lyrics written on it---you just /knew/ the answer. That's what
all knowledge is for me! It's to describe it any further without leaning on
visual metaphor. Concepts float in a void of nothing, accessible as ideas, but
not as pictures.

Aphantasia affect my memory. The best way I can describe it is that I remember
/that/ things happened but don't remember them /happening/. I've known that my
memory was different since I was in high school. For a long time, it made me sad
that I couldn't /remember/ things in the same way as my peers. To a degree, it
still does, but the context of aphantasia has helped me make my peace with it.

When I tell the story of a memory, however, everything changes. I still can't
"see" it but, for that brief moment, it goes from a list of things that happened
to something that, in some sense, /is happening/.
I can't give an accurate description of what its like to tell a story if you
don't have aphantasia. When I think about a memory, it's like reading sheet
music, but I tell that the story its like seeing an orchestra perform the same
piece---both contain the same information, but the story is alive in a way the
pure memory isn't. Just as every conductor has their own interpretation of a pieced
every retelling is slightly different, shaped to the audience and context.

It's no wonder, then, that I love selling stories. This "magic power" they have
to transport us out of the present and into some third place is real---if only
real for me. When I'm hear into other people tell stories, I don't see the
stories unfold in front of me. Instead, they suck me in and I experience them
the same I experience memory. For me, stories and memories are hopeless
entwined, each begetting the other in an eternal dance. I still have no idea if
I'm any good at it, but I do know that I will not stop telling stories
any time soon.

:END:

There's an undergraduate in the graduate algebra class who seems to be in a bit
over his head. While the lectures don't assume any previous knowledge of algebra,
they move quickly if it's your first time seeing the ideas---what an
undergraduate course would cover in the span of 10-12 weeks we are doing in
four. Late last week, he asked the professor a question and I could tell that he
wasn't quite satisfied with the answer. By habit I leaned forward to whisper
something along the lines of "If you want, stop by the grad offices after class
and I can explain" but I stopped myself.  The grad offices the department gave
us don't lend themselves guest visits (but more on that later).  At Cal
Poly (where I did my masters) we always joked that we were packed into the grad
offices like sardines but the offices at Wash U are practically overflowing.

When I met with my academic advisor prior to the start of the
semester, I asked about the office situation. After chuckling he told
me that first years are each given a carrel but assured me that the accommodations
got better as you progressed through the program. A carrel is a little desk unit
with a built-in shelf that you might find in a library.
They're perfectly functional as a desk but the steep walls are a collaborative
point of friction.  The office is an integral part of graduate school---it's a
place to study and rest between classes, to ask your peers for help, and to chat
about anything and everything when the math gets a little too abstract and you
need a break.
While it may come as a surprise to those who are unfamiliar with the peculiar
mannerisms of mathematicians, the center-point of any math office is not the
desk, but the chalkboard.

Mathematicians have a bit of a complex when it comes to chalkboards. Maybe it's for
purely aesthetic reason, but a proper slate chalkboard is just /better/ than a
whiteboard. While everyone has their preference between the brands of
chalk a department might stock, one manufacturer sits king: Hagoromo. Stick of Hagoromo
are slightly wider than your average chalk (so it sits more comfortably in the
hand) and it is coated in a thin layer of wax so that your fingers don't get
dusty. Not everyone uses Hagoromo regularly, but if there is a stick available,
I don't know a single mathematician who would turn it down.  According to
mathematical legend, no one has ever written a false theorem when holding a
stick of Hagoromo. Young mathematicians watch university surplus sales to try
and score a slate chalkboard at a hefty discount. The chalkboard is the
hearth of the mathematical community---where students and professors gather to
share ideas and prove new theorems.

I'm a sucker for tradition, so when I learned about this mathematical quirk
during my senior year of undergrad I went out and bought a cheap chalkboard and
a pack of Hagoromo. While I've never collaborated with anyone on this
chalkboard, it still hangs a few feet to the left of my desk. When I first
started writing on it, I knew that I was participating in a story that stretched
back through generations of math students. It brought me joy to think about a
potential future where I would work on problem sets in an office with my peers.

*** The Art of the Grad Office
**** The Dungeons of Building 38
I moved to San Luis Obispo in February 2021 and spent the first four months doing
classes online. The pandemic was in full swing and
I only stepped foot on campus a handful of times before in-person classes
resumed in September. I spent most of that spring and summer in my apartment
with the occasional trip back to Sacramento. When I started my second year I was
confronted with two disparate truths: I really liked my peers but I knew that
I was moving in less than a year. I'm too much of a romantic to pretend that I
wasn't going to make friends but that deadline loomed over SLO just like the
golden hills.

I quickly fell into a rhythm in SLO, with the weeks marked by Taco Tuesdays,
grading quizzes, and puzzling through Dr. Brussel's pathological problem sets.
Our offices were simple---roughly the square footage of a dorm room, four heavy
duty 8' tables topped with iMacs and ancient printers lined three of the walls
with a chalkboard across the fourth. While four people shared each
office, it was not uncommon for eight or ten to congregate in a single
office. This overcrowding led to us nicknaming the offices "the dungeons."
In our office, we moved all the computers to one
corner so that we could work on our laptops or spread out whatever books we
were referencing for our classes or research---this had the added bonus of
making room for an espresso machine, coffee grinder, and pour-over setup. Since
our classes were down the hall from the offices, it was not uncommon to get to
campus before sunrise and not emerge from the dungeons until after the sun had
set.

As quarters passed, we grew close and learned how to make the best of life in
the dungeons: Karl and I would drag each other into the sun for some much-needed
vitamin-D, Taco Tuesdays went later and later as friends became family, we
enrolled in a bowling class and spent two hours a week bowling poorly,[fn:1] I
befriended a few students outside of the major and spend time not thinking about math.
And yet, one thing never changed: after class we would congregate around a
chalkboard in the "social" office and go over anything that confused us in the
lecture.

The chalkboard in my office in Cal Poly was old and pitted, but it was clearly
well loved. Over the 21-22 academic year we put over a hundred sticks
worth of chalk on that board; some of it was Prang (the brand provided by the
department) but most of it was Hagoromo. Sometimes a week would go by without
facing a problem that was so difficult it required chalkboard work---when this
happened the boards would collect doodles from some of the art students who were
friends of the department.
But then, when the problem sets were particularly pathological, we gathered
around a chalkboard and worked through problems together.  While it was the
adventures off campus that made us family, we were always at home around a chalkboard.

**** The Carrels of Cupples I
Imagine my surprise, then, when I first walked into the basement of the Math
Department at Wash U and saw the first-year offices. Over twenty carrels filled
a room not much bigger than my office in SLO.
Cold CFL's in a colder, hanging industrial frame washed out the
little bit of natural light coming from the tiny windows near the ceiling.
I would come to find out that
there was a bit of drama surrounding office placements. As you move through
the program, you change offices. You are still confined to a carrel, but the
square footage of the office itself increases. Perhaps most importantly,
however, the offices move to higher floors and have larger windows. This year
the previous fourth years didn't move into the fifth year
offices---meaning that none of the other years could move up. As result, the
first and second years are all stuck in a single office. The department added
more carrels in the middle of room so every student had their own desk,  but the
resulting office is a maze of desks, most of which sit empty because many
of the other students (understandably) want to study elsewhere.

The first-year offices only has a single chalkboard; it's three feet wide and
sits on a wobbly wooden stand. Even when cleaned, it still looks a little dusty.
On the chalk ledge sits half a stick of white Crayola (which writes a little
worse than Prang) and a nub of sidewalk chalk.[fn:2] It's a perfectly functional
chalkboard, but it's hard to love. Compared to Cal Poly (where the grad offices
were built around the chalkboard) the board here feels like a bit of an afterthought.

Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful that the department gave us offices---many
graduate students don't get an office until they pass their qualifying exams.
Comparison may be the thief of joy, but I can't help it. The labyrinthine spread
of carrels feels more like a dungeon than anything in Cal Poly ever did. The
chalkboard, the supposed "hearth" of the mathematical community is relegated to
the only corner they couldn't fit a desk. At the end of the day, it isn't the
kind of office you invite a curious undergraduate into so you can explain the
nuances of the first isomorphism theorem.

*** The Trouble with Change
At this point in my life, I'm no stranger to moving to a new city. While I lived
in the same house from birth to graduating high school, I just had my third
"first week of college." When you start undergrad, everything feels like a
whirlwind; you're on your own for the first time, no one is going to tell you
when to go to bed or what to eat, and everyone around you is experiencing the
same new-found freedom. Every September, the spirit of Bacchus descends upon
college campuses and first-years everywhere are overtaken. Looking back on it,
it feels almost otherworldly. I am an introvert to my core and yet I was
attending event after event meeting new people left and right. It seemed like
that was just what you did at the beginning of college.

The transition into my masters was different. Sure, COVID made in-person events
complicated but even when transmission rates were down and restrictions loosened
there was a decided lack of the bacchan revelries that marked the beginning of
undergrad. Not only were we all in our early 20s, over half of my cohort were
"4+1 students" who did their undergraduate studies at Cal Poly---meaning they
were already close friends. When I started my masters, I didn't feel like I had
to rush to make friends. The relationships grew slower, but more organically.
Even with a deadline on the horizon, classmates naturally became friends, and
friends became family.

Now I'm here in Saint Louis making this transition a third time. While it's
going as I expected---slowly growing closer with my cohort, working on problem
sets together and planning the occasion trip---I can't help but compare Wash U
to Cal Poly. The transition to my masters was so distinct from that to my
undergrad that comparing the two didn't feel appropriate. With Wash U, on the
other hand, it feels almost identical. The people here are lovely. I can see
many of them becoming life-long friends and collaborators. I can't help but
thinking, however, that I don't want a new circle. The people I had in SLO were
amazing; they were family. I know that making the comparison will only make the
adjustment period longer but I can't help it.

The fundamental problem here is bound in time. Strangers can't (or perhaps
shouldn't) become close friends overnight. To become close with my
new cohort I need to lean in---just as I did a year ago. Commit to the new friends
and let time run its course.

When I sat down to write, I hoped I would discover something about the nature of
change, to find the beginnings of an answer as to what it all means. On the other
side of a few hundred words, I think it's a question wrongly put. Trying to
understand what change means is like trying to understand the ocean---maybe
someone understands it, but I certainly don't.

The only thing that I can do is be present. So I guess that's what I will do. I
will work on the problem sets with my classmates and hope that it's
not a fluke that generations of graduate students have become family following
the same pattern. It may not be perfect, but that little, dusty-green chalkboard
on the wobbly stand just might be the saving grace for that harshly lit basement
office.
