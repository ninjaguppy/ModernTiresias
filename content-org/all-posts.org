I am a first year PhD student at Washington University in Saint Louis. During my
undergraduate degree I had lots of space to write. While I love spending my days
thinking about sheaves, analytic functions, and cohomology, I wanted a place to
get the thoughts out of my head and onto a page.

If all goes well, there should be a post here every Sunday on whatever thoughts
have wedged themselves into the caffeine-addled brain of a graduate student
preparing for qualifying exams. I tend to think about memory, narrative, beauty,
among other things, but the last thing I want to do is put my work here in a
box. I make no promises about the quality of the posts here---this is a space
primarily for me to process my own thoughts---but if you're interested in what I
have to say, please follow along!
** TODO Add photo, pronouns, etc to this page
How do you do the thing where its like

I'm a three weeks into my PhD and something is gnawing at me.
*** Thoughts
Thinking about change in a fundamental way -- the title is mostly just eye
catching even if it might be true for now
 - In undergrad you just want the transition to happen faster (skip a month bc
   you know whats coming is great)
 - Masters was that much more mature (plus I was more joining an established group)
 - But now none of the contexts are new (still have an office, apt, etc) and I
   can't help but compare I think I want the old one back
   - I know this is "wrong" and I will find my place here but it will never be
     that---and I guess taht has to be okay.
 - Hiding some of your shameful mannerisms

This is my post body.

Now with even more meaningless content!

* Post Ideas
** Why Start a Blog
The wants of starting to write but actually its about the wants of a young
adult.

** Something about missing California
- Actually about place
https://twitter.com/FredFredSanders/status/1569726910535704577
  -- This is quote from Centuries; could be interesting!

** "Breaking my Macbook for Fun"
Why do I care about the tools I use? Reflecting on what it means to be
"productive" in a capitalist society---something deeper than avoiding
productivity porn

** Something about why I haven't sold the table yet?
When I sell it and put the right thing there then I'm Officially Here

Its one thing to have a cabinet that you don't organize -- eventually that just
becomes what that cabinet/corner/drawer is supposed to be. Its different with
the dining room table; its too big to ever blend in.

I haven't taken the video of a walkthrough

** Nihilism Questions in Absurdity :erin:
A review of Everything Everywhere. Maybe reread some Chestron.

** Gaining independence => gaining control (and their to time + place + distance from your old concept of home) :erin:
thinking about the process of moving out and being more independent
+ use the metaphor of how my couch/table combo has changed over the year
  + How its changed, and how the person who places their coffee upon it has
    changed
    + Missing Nathaniels couch

** Sisyphus and the Art of Eating Lunch :erin:
Reflections on how my relationship with food -- how lunch and other meals have
changed in the various phases of my life. Begrudingly, I should talk about the
continuous of the Eating disorder.

** Narratives and Aphantasia :erin:
QQ: Why am I so fascinated with stories. Am I a good a story-teller? I have no
idea, but I do have experience so maybe that's something.

I tell the stories bc I /*actually do*/ get sucked into the stories.
** I'm not going to do the crossword. :erin:
I love the idea of doing the crossword with my partner over morning coffee, but
like I don't do the crossword and I probably won't start.

** The Case for Lower Case :erin:
gramatical correctness of my generation as a push back against 133T5P3AK. but
now people just a little bit younger have swung the other way---you can get
decent data about someones age by whether or not they write i or I. I have
auto-caps on. Often I will have to force my phone to be in lower case---does it
express a particular emotion? it is social camoflauge? Whats up with that
+ could mention that the place i do my writing in doesn't have autocaps and I
  only capitalize things here half the time
