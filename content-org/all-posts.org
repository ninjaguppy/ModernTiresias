Since there is embedded html in this page, things don't work right with ox-hugo.
I'm just going to edit the about-me.md for now instead. Below is a backup of
what the .md file should look like.

In case you ever change your mind, here is the command that needs to go in the
"properties" drop down to export correctly.

I am a first year PhD student at Washington University in Saint Louis. During my
undergraduate degree I had lots of space to write. While I love spending my days
thinking about sheaves, analytic functions, and cohomology, I wanted a place to
get the thoughts out of my head and onto a page.
</p>


If all goes well, there should be a post here every Sunday on whatever thoughts
have wedged themselves into the caffeine-addled brain of a graduate student
preparing for qualifying exams. I tend to think about memory, narrative, beauty,
among other things, but the last thing I want to do is put my work here in a
box. I make no promises about the quality of the posts here---this is a space
primarily for me to process my own thoughts---but if you're interested in what I
have to say, please follow along!

** DRFT I Think I Liked My Masters Better
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: liked-my-masters-better
:END:
I'm a three weeks into my PhD and something is gnawing at me.
*** Thoughts
Thinking about change in a fundamental way -- the title is mostly just eye
catching even if it might be true for now
 - In undergrad you just want the transition to happen faster (skip a month bc
   you know whats coming is great)
 - Masters was that much more mature (plus I was more joining an established group)
 - But now none of the contexts are new (still have an office, apt, etc) and I
   can't help but compare I think I want the old one back
   - I know this is "wrong" and I will find my place here but it will never be
     that---and I guess taht has to be okay.
 - Hiding some of your shameful mannerisms

This is my post body.

Now with even more meaningless content!

* Post Ideas
** Why Start a Blog
The wants of starting to write but actually its about the wants of a young
adult.

** Something about missing California
- Actually about place
https://twitter.com/FredFredSanders/status/1569726910535704577
  -- This is quote from Centuries; could be interesting!

** "Breaking my Macbook for Fun"
Why do I care about the tools I use? Reflecting on what it means to be
"productive" in a capitalist society---something deeper than avoiding
productivity porn

** Something about why I haven't sold the table yet?
When I sell it and put the right thing there then I'm Officially Here

Its one thing to have a cabinet that you don't organize -- eventually that just
becomes what that cabinet/corner/drawer is supposed to be. Its different with
the dining room table; its too big to ever blend in.

I haven't taken the video of a walkthrough

** Nihilism Questions in Absurdity :erin:
A review of Everything Everywhere. Maybe reread some Chestron.

** Gaining independence => gaining control (and their to time + place + distance from your old concept of home) :erin:
thinking about the process of moving out and being more independent
+ use the metaphor of how my couch/table combo has changed over the year
  + How its changed, and how the person who places their coffee upon it has
    changed
    + Missing Nathaniels couch

** Sisyphus and the Art of Eating Lunch :erin:
Reflections on how my relationship with food -- how lunch and other meals have
changed in the various phases of my life. Begrudingly, I should talk about the
continuous of the Eating disorder.

** Narratives and Aphantasia :erin:
QQ: Why am I so fascinated with stories. Am I a good a story-teller? I have no
idea, but I do have experience so maybe that's something.

I tell the stories bc I /*actually do*/ get sucked into the stories.
** I'm not going to do the crossword. :erin:
I love the idea of doing the crossword with my partner over morning coffee, but
like I don't do the crossword and I probably won't start.

** The Case for Lower Case :erin:
gramatical correctness of my generation as a push back against 133T5P3AK. but
now people just a little bit younger have swung the other way---you can get
decent data about someones age by whether or not they write i or I. I have
auto-caps on. Often I will have to force my phone to be in lower case---does it
express a particular emotion? it is social camoflauge? Whats up with that
+ could mention that the place i do my writing in doesn't have autocaps and I
  only capitalize things here half the time
