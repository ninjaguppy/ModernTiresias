I am a first year PhD student at Washington University in Saint Louis. During my
undergraduate degree I had lots of space to write. While I love spending my days
thinking about sheaves, analytic functions, and cohomology, I wanted a place to
get the thoughts out of my head and onto a page.

If all goes well, there should be a post here every Sunday on whatever thoughts
have wedged themselves into the caffeine-addled brain of a graduate student
preparing for qualifying exams. I tend to think about memory, narrative, beauty,
among other things, but the last thing I want to do is put my work here in a
box. I make no promises about the quality of the posts here---this is a space
primarily for me to process my own thoughts---but if you're interested in what I
have to say, please follow along!

** PBSH Consider the Tulip: Why Star Wars Might Just Be Bad

:END:
I promise we will get to the tulips. Star Wars is really bad and we have lot to talk about.

The Mandalorian is really bad. I can't stop watching it.
I don't watch it every as soon as it drops, but whenever I have two episodes to watch I get
excited. Perhaps a little too excited, because The Mandalorian is bad. Like,
really bad. The one I watched today
features cameos from Jack Black, Lizzo, and Christopher Lloyd. They're in extravagant
costumes but they are just playing themselves. There's also a
fish-alien Romeo and Juliet in the B plot. Actually, maybe Star Wars is
generally bad.

There's this old joke about Star Wars fans:
#+begin_quote
Star Wars Fans be like: Star Wars would be so good if it was good.
#+end_quote
The critique is so cutting that part of me wants to deflect and search for a
redeeming quality in Star Wars. I want to type one right now about the world
building and the characters and how we really can just ignore George Lucas and
everything he thought was good. I /do/ think that Star Wars would be really good if
it was good.  The thing is though, Star Wars is *bad.*

If you ignore the original trilogy (which I think we should---even if we
try, no one is able to remove the rose-tinted glasses and have an honest
conversation about how they're just alright), then there are three pieces of
Star Wars media that we all agree are good: Rogue One, The Clone Wars, and
Andor. Maybe in exploring what makes them so good, I'll discover why I love a
franchise that consistently releases sub-par content.

Rogue one is a little cheesy. The whole movie
exists for the last ten minutes. Rogue One is 120 minutes of decent (but not
amazing) action movie followed by ten minutes of fan service. It knew exactly
what it was doing and it did it very well.

Now we turn to The Clone Wars. Here's the thing about The Clone Wars: this show
is 66 and a half hours long. I can say that /maybe/ six hours of that is good. The
majority of this show is so bad that it took me almost six years to watch it.
You might think that means that over the course of seven seasons the show gets
better; this is not the case. The bad episodes stay just as bad---they might
look a lot prettier because of the better technology and budget, but they are
still bad episodes. Instead, the good episodes get *amazing*.

The final season consists of three arcs. The first is
pretty good, the second is /very bad/. But the third arc. The third arc is "The Siege
of Mandalore." The third arc runs parallel to The Revenge of the Sith. The Third
Arc is the best hour and thirty minutes of Star Wars I have ever seen. It might
even be an Objectively Good Story. But here's the problem: the rest of the show
is soul-suckingly boring. You should not watch it. After 65 hours of bad tv you
will be rewarded and you might even feel like it was worth it. But this show is bad.
The Siege of Mandalore cannot fix that.


Andor. Andor is good. Andor is mind-bogglingly good. It is a wonderful
piece of anti-fascist media masterfully telling a grounded story that is still
high-stakes. It is full of silly looking aliens. I can /maybe/ rationalize the
rose-tinted glasses with which I view the rest of Star Wars and concede that
everything else
bad, but if Andor is bad I will never trust my critical thinking and media
literacy skills again. If you watch it, you will feel the cognitive dissonance
of a Star Wars story being good. But if you can get past this it's genuinely
amazing.

I would be remiss if I didn't talk about Kenobi. Just like Gen X can't ever be
honest about whether or not the original trilogy is good, I can't be honest
about Kenobi. I enjoyed every second of it. No one could convince me it was bad.
They could show me every little thing wrong to me and it would never change
anything. I may be a little scared to rewatch it, but I will always love it.

If it's so bad, then why do I watch every single piece of Star Wars media? I
could tell you about my love of All Things Camp. I know Star Wars is camp and
that it has always been camp. It may be
camp, but I don't enjoy it like I do camp. I love things like Riverdale or High
School Musical the Musical the Series---shows that live and breath camp. It's not
that I don't want Star Wars to be camp because I don't like camp. I can't admit that
it's camp because the way I love it isn't post-ironic-in-on-the-joke love. It's
genuine i-get-the-joke-and-im-unironically-in-on-it love. I cannot and will not
let myself admit that Star War is camp because, at least for me, it isn't.

But here's the thing: I'm a Star Wars fan who just wrote 800 words of "Star Wars would
be so good if it were good". What if Star Wars is just bad? Star Wars can just
be bad!  I am allowed to enjoy it for being bad. I don’t have to have these deep
intellectual reasons to enjoy it---it can be bad!
I'm allowed to like Star Wars unabashedly. I don't need a reason to enjoy a
thing; I'm allowed to like star wars without an articulate defense of its
merits! That's it---that's the reason I'm allowed to like it!

I've done it again.

On the other hand, perhaps there’s fruit
in looking at the things that make me feel warm. I've been feeling the
cold-distance between myself and the world more often lately. Despite its many
flaws, Star Wars makes me feel warmer. Maybe if I understood why I
like it I could find that elsewhere. But also maybe I should just let it be the
way that it is. Maybe it can just be bad and I can like it anyway. Maybe there's
a world out there where I *don't* have to have an opinion on Star Wars. I may not
live in that world right now but I would like to.

------

Can I be honest about something? This whole "let's explore star wars and see what
we can find" business? It's fake. I went on this journey earlier. I wrote more
than I intended, and I got lost in the writing in a way that I didn't expect,
but I didn't "discover" anything in real time. Those last two
paragraphs? They were largely copied from a text I wrote an hour ago. The
honesty isn't manufactured, but the real-time discovery certainly is. I knew the
outline of this piece when I sat down to write it. I knew the whole thing, and I
know how it ends.

If I know the ending, why would I lie? Why not present the cold-hard facts I
discovered on my journey? Simple: it made for better writing. I wanted to take
you on the journey I walk every time I try to rationalize my love of Star Wars.

Does that undermine what I've written? Does it make it feel less genuine?
Would it help to know that I knew I was going to write that question? That this *whole
thing* is manufactured? That I know the beats I'm going to hit and I'm letting myself be
honest within that framework? Does it make it the art less genuine if you can
*feel* the form bulging out like this?

Wow. That got dark. Star Wars isn't supposed to be deep. I'm doing it again,
aren't I? I do genuinely think I'm allowed to like Star Wars without a reason. But still,
a part of me really wants to have a reason. I want to be able to explore the
nuances of the things that make me feel warm. I want that exploration to not be
a bad thing.
There's a difference, however, between exploring my love of something and a
cold, intellectual dissection of its merits. My love of Star Wars is too
insecure for that genuine exploration; the moment I try to explore it I become
defensive of would-be attacks against a franchise that I've loved my whole
life---for some reason I don't know how to let the flaws be.

I was honest about knowing the framework of this piece. I may not have known the
journey I was going to take to get here but I knew this was the destination. You
have too; it was the title of this essay: The Tulip. I'm not quite sure how the
Tulip relates to Star Wars. I can try to explain it but for some reason I don't
want to. Maybe if I can look at the tulip like this, I will one day be able to
look at other things this way.

-----

On the Tulip:

I've had tulips tattooed on my arm for three years now. We don't really have
tulips in California. They're not absent from our floral vocabulary but they
aren't around in the same way they are in the Midwest. Here, they are /everywhere/.
Anywhere you look you see these beautiful, strange dots of color.
When I first saw the red tulips next door, I didn't recognize them as tulips. I
recognized all of the other tulips with their egg-shaped bulb but these red
flowers were completely open and looked almost like a hollow rose.
It turns out that that's what tulips are supposed to look like. When they are
fully bloomed and open for the day they don't look like the ones everyone thinks
of.

Maybe you knew that. Maybe this whole time you've known that the flowers on my
tattoo didn't look like that in real life. Maybe my artist knew and chose to
draw them closed because that's how we want to think of them. Do you think the
tulips like that?

I */really/* want to make a metaphor out of the tulips. It's right there. It would
be an amazing central metaphor for a piece looking at the way I see myself.
Maybe that's what I wrote today. Here's the thing though: I don't care. I don't
want to analyze the tulip. I'm perfectly content to let the tulip be both the
picturesque, slightly shy flower /and/ the bold, hollow rose. I spent the last
week trying to outline an essay about them before I realized that I would much
rather just look at them. Then I started looking at the tulips. You can find a
selection of my favorites (along with other wildflowers) below.

This is the first part in a three(ish) part series about narrative---while I would love to
write one long piece with all of the ideas, the outline became too sprawling to
write in one week. I make no claims of expertise, these are just the thought of
one mathematician with a heart for the liberal arts. Part one discusses my own
relationship to storytelling
and contains mild spoilers for /Everything Everywhere All At Once/.

-----

When I was 13 my grandfather and I went to Australia. Our group spent a few days
on K'gari (also known as Fraser Island)---our guide was an aboriginal man whose
family had lived on the island for generations. All of the electricity on
K'gari Island turns off at shortly after sunset, so light pollution is virtually
nonexistent at night. On the last night we spent on
K'gari, we sat around a fire and he told us stories from their mythology:
their creation narrative, the stories of past heroes, and the history and myths
surrounding the didgeridoo. Unsurprisingly, there were stories about the figures
they found in the constellations. On K'gari, however, there are portions of the
sky that are so dense with stars that the locals would create constellations out
of the negative space in the sky. I remember being fascinated by the stories. At
one point I stepped away from the fire and laid on the ground to get a better
look at the stars. I can't claim that I was somehow sucked into the
narrative and saw the heroes dancing among the stars. There was no "fantastical
imagery" conjured in my mind; all I saw were the stars,
but I know that I experienced something special that night.  I already had a soft
spot for the art of storytelling, but listening to those stories passed down
through generations convinced me that there is something a little bit magical
about storytelling.


*** The Human Experience
I'm not going to pretend that I have some sort of "extra-special knowledge" when
it comes to the history of storytelling, but I do know this: storytelling is
central to the human experience. I can't cite a study but I know deep in my
bones---the same way I know how to raise my arm or know what an apple looks
like---that humans have always been telling stories. Storytelling, of course,
serves an evolutionary purpose. Stories can be used to spread life-saving
information through a population group. To reduce storytelling to an
evolutionary mechanism, however, is like reducing man to a featherless biped.
When someone tells you a story, they invite you to share an experience. The
beauty of storytelling is evident; it's something that humans have done for
millennia: gather around the campfire and weave epic tales of good and evil---or
sometimes just the epic tale of what they did that day.

It's partially this communal aspect that draws me to narrative.
One summer in high school I found myself in a movie theater watching an animated
movie that was entirely in Spanish. One of my friends has cracked her phone
screen so a group of us spent the afternoon at the mall while it was getting
repaired. We window shopped for a while but we still had two hours to kill
by the time we exhausted the offerings. When we wandered over to the attached
movie theater we say they were playing /Un Gallo con Mucho Huevos/ in ten minutes
and immediately bought tickets. Thankfully there were English subtitle but, as
far as I could tell, we were the only people in the packed theater that didn't
speak Spanish.

The next 98 minutes felt a bit like a fever dream. Occasionally, the subtitles
would give away a joke a few seconds before it would be spoken on screen. This
meant that  my friends and I would laugh a few seconds earlier that the rest of
the theater. I don't remember any of the plot (aside from a satirical character
named "Snoop Duck") but I do remember how it felt to be in that theater. I was
with people that I loved watching a movie on a random Saturday afternoon. Sure,
some of the jokes didn't translate into the subtitles and we sat there silently
while the theater erupted in laughter around us. It didn't matter that sometimes
the jokes would hit differently and would we would laugh at the wrong time. When
we laughed, it was a thing we did together---sometimes just the three of us but,
when we were lucky, it was the entire theater.
The plot of the movie, it turns out, was insignificant in light of the experience
of the story.

**** A Historical Perspective
In the beginning of undergrad I spent so much time waxing poetic about the
importance of narrative that in my second year I decided to write a paper about
it. Titled "Dress Like It's Fall and It Will Become Fall," it explored the ways
in which a society is shaped by its cultural mythos. I won't get into the
details of the full argument, but the central idea was that the stories we tell
ourselves shape the way we see the world. While it may be blatant propaganda,
Virgil's /Aeneid/ tells us what it meant to be a "good Roman" in the early Roman
Empire. Its particular picture of piety tied together filial, religious, and
patriotic devotion.
The epic's hero, Aeneas (who founds modern Rome in the final chapter) has many
not-so-subtle parallels to the then-newly-crowned Augustus; Virgil seems to be
telling us, "You know how we all revere Aeneas for his piety? We should do the
same thing with Augustus. After all, just like Aeneas was the last hope for
Troy after the city's fall Augustus has saved us from the turmoil of the past
decades."
For generations after its composure, Romans looked to /The Aeneid/ for
guidance---over two thousand year later we still read it to gain insight into the
Roman mind.

/The Aeneid/ is not a one-off example! In fact, it isn't even confined to epic
poetry. I won't go so far as to say that /every/ narrative has some "deeper
meaning" that it is trying convey,[fn:1] but for the vast majority of stories, it's
safe to assume they have something to teach you. Whether or not the things they
have to say are worth listening to, however, is another question entirely.
This link between thematic ideas and narrative is why I'm such a big proponent
of the Liberal Arts. When done right, it exposes us to some of the best pieces
of literature and teaches us to engage critically with the world around us.

After my sophomore year, I solidified many of my thoughts surrounding
storytelling. I knew that my thoughts on storytelling would likely never stop evolving
but at least I had formalized my opinion on the place of a cultural mythos in society.

*** Compulsive Storytelling
With my grandiose views what stories "mean," its no surprise that I love telling
them. I'm not sure if I'm any good at it,[fn:2] but I definitely have lots of
practice. Storytelling is so woven into my being that I realized I tell
stories compulsively /while telling a story/.

Some coworkers and I were grabbing a coffee and pastries between setups during
Family Weekend at Biola. I started telling a story (sadly I can't remember what it was)
and one of the trainees stopped me.

"Wait," he said. "Does this have anything to
do with what we were talking before or are you changing the subject?"
I was a little embarrassed---I knew my story's relevance was tangential at best but it
stung to have that pointed out before it was halfway finished.

Thankfully, another coworker jumped to my rescue. "Don't worry," he said. "Lucas
has this super power where he starts a story that seems completely random but he
somehow always connects it back."

While what he said was kind, it set the bar of relevance a little too high for
what my story could deliver. Thankfully, he had given me another way out. "I
have this weird thing with storytelling," I said. "When I think of a story that
is related to topic of conversation it bounces around my head until I let it out
by telling the story."
This seemed to satiate my coworkers and we went back to discussing the next room
setup: what gear we needed to pick up, how fast the turn around was, etc. In
the back of my mind, however, I was turning over what I had just said.

You see, I
spent years justifying to myself why I didn't have OCD; I had all sorts of
rationalizations for why my experience was distinct. When I read /Turtles All
the Way Down/, a book which is, in part, about the author's experience of
OCD, I told a friend "I've never seen my own experience of mental illness so
thoroughly explored... but that's weird because I don't have OCD." During an
intake exam at a new therapist a few months later, I told the examiner "I have
obsessive thought patterns, but not in an OCD way because there aren't any
compulsions that go along with them."

After years of rationalization, there I was: seated outside a coffee shop with
my coworkers having described an obsessive thought pattern and a corresponding
compulsion.

This realization put my love of storytelling in context. It's not just that I
love storytelling in the abstract and liked to take on the mantle of
storyteller from time to time---I have no choice but to be a storyteller. When I
think of a story I obsess over it, turning over the details in my mind in the
hopes to arrive at some "local maximum" of quality. Because of my OCD, this
process will continue until I tell the story to the group.
As far as
my compulsions go, this is relatively harmless. With some therapy, I'm able
keep the stories in my head when the situation isn't appropriate. But at the end
of the day, I /like/ telling stories. I like what stories mean; how they bring
people together and draw them into community.

It turns out, however, that even this context was incomplete. For the final
piece of the puzzle we need to change the subject---but I promise that it will relate.

*** The Apple

I want you to look at the nearest flat surface and imagine an apple. Not some
platonic ideal of an apple, but pretend there is a real apple sitting there.
What color is it? Does it have a bruise? Is there a perfect little leaf on the
stem?
Now that you've got the picture in your mind, how would you rate your ability to
"see" the apple an a scale of 1-10 where 10 is "I know its made up, but I can practically see it"
and a 1 being "what are you even talking about, of course I can't see anything"?[fn:3]

Most of the people I ask give an answer above 6 or 7; on a good day I'm a 1.
The concept of a "mind's eye" is totally foreign to me---until recently I
thought it was just a useful metaphor.
I have a condition known as aphantasia, which is sometimes colloquially known as
/mind blindness/. Put simply, there are no pictures in my head.
According to a recent study in the journal of Consciousness and
Cognition,[fn:4] less than 1% of the population have full aphantasia and about 4%
have dim/vague mental imagery (if any at all).

There are some reports of so-called /acquired/ aphantasia (usually the result of
some sort of traumatic brain injury) but mine is congenital---I've had it my
whole life and never known anything else. Until November 2018 (just over a year
after the coffee shop story) I had no idea that I was different. When people
would say "picture a beach" I always thought was a way to say
"think about the ideas of peace and serenity." I figured it, like the piety of
Aeneas, was societal shorthand for a shared concept. Imagine my surprise, then,
when I learned that other people could just "see things" in their head!

Suppose I were to ask you to complete the lyrics, "Mary had a____________." Now
chances are, you were able to fill in /little lamb/ with thinking about it. It's
not like you had to picture Mary in their shepherd's outfit or imagine a sheet
of paper with the lyrics written on it---you just /knew/ the answer. That's what
all knowledge is for me! It's hard to describe it any further without leaning on
visual metaphor. For me, concepts float in a void of nothing, accessible as ideas, but
not as pictures.

Aphantasia affects my memory. The best way I can describe it is that I remember
/that/ things happened but don't remember them /happening/. I've known that my
memory was different since I was in high school. For a long time, it made me sad
that I couldn't remember things in the same way as my peers. To a degree, it
still does, but the context of aphantasia has helped me make my peace with it.

When I tell the story of a memory, however, everything changes. I still can't
"see" it but, for that brief moment, it goes from a list of things that happened
to something that, in some sense, /is happening/.
I can't give an accurate description of what its like to tell a story if you
don't have aphantasia, so maybe this is a universal experience. When I think
about a memory, it's like reading sheet music, but when I tell that same story it's
like seeing an orchestra perform the same
piece---both contain the same information, but the story is alive in a way the
pure memory isn't. Just as every conductor has their own interpretation of a piece
every retelling is slightly different, shaped to the audience and context.

It's no wonder, then, that I love telling stories. This "magic power" they have
to transport us out of the present and into some third place is real---if only
real for me. When I hear into other people tell stories, I don't see the
stories unfold in front of me. Instead, they suck me in and I experience them
the same I experience memory. For me, stories and memories are hopelessly
entwined, each begetting the other in an eternal dance.
The stars above K'gari may not have "come alive" and shown me the heroes of old
but that night something magical happened. Words decay into imprecision when I
try to explain it---they strain, crack, and break under the tension imparted by
experience. Perhaps my love of storytelling is looking to that moment and trying
to recreate it. Perhaps its a consequence of my brain chemistry, a obsessive
thought that needs to be freed or a memory made alive again. Each of these still
feel like a featherless biped, reducing something vast and intricate into a tidy
little box. The beauty of storytelling may be evident, but its nature is
something elusive; a word whispered from the brambles asking us to listen and
follow.

[fn:1] I'm sure there are counter examples of "stories that have no deeper
meaning" but these are few and far between and I can't think of any off the top
of my head.

[fn:2] Its one of the things where it's hard to trust the answers you get to the
question of "Am I good at this." They're probably telling the truth, but you
will never know.

[fn:3] For further scale calibration, some people say that they can
"superimpose" the apple into reality---I think that falls somewhere in the 7-8
range. I wish I could help with calibrating this part of the scale but to me the
apple is completely made up and has no visual component.

There's an undergraduate in the graduate algebra class who seems to be in a bit
over his head. While the lectures don't assume any previous knowledge of algebra,
they move quickly if it's your first time seeing the ideas---what an
undergraduate course would cover in the span of 10-12 weeks we are doing in
four. Late last week, he asked the professor a question and I could tell that he
wasn't quite satisfied with the answer. By habit I leaned forward to whisper
something along the lines of "If you want, stop by the grad offices after class
and I can explain" but I stopped myself.  The grad offices the department gave
us don't lend themselves guest visits (but more on that later).  At Cal
Poly (where I did my masters) we always joked that we were packed into the grad
offices like sardines but the offices at Wash U are practically overflowing.

When I met with my academic advisor prior to the start of the
semester, I asked about the office situation. After chuckling he told
me that first years are each given a carrel but assured me that the accommodations
got better as you progressed through the program. A carrel is a little desk unit
with a built-in shelf that you might find in a library.
They're perfectly functional as a desk but the steep walls are a collaborative
point of friction.  The office is an integral part of graduate school---it's a
place to study and rest between classes, to ask your peers for help, and to chat
about anything and everything when the math gets a little too abstract and you
need a break.
While it may come as a surprise to those who are unfamiliar with the peculiar
mannerisms of mathematicians, the center-point of any math office is not the
desk, but the chalkboard.

Mathematicians have a bit of a complex when it comes to chalkboards. Maybe it's for
purely aesthetic reason, but a proper slate chalkboard is just /better/ than a
whiteboard. While everyone has their preference between the brands of
chalk a department might stock, one manufacturer sits king: Hagoromo. Stick of Hagoromo
are slightly wider than your average chalk (so it sits more comfortably in the
hand) and it is coated in a thin layer of wax so that your fingers don't get
dusty. Not everyone uses Hagoromo regularly, but if there is a stick available,
I don't know a single mathematician who would turn it down.  According to
mathematical legend, no one has ever written a false theorem when holding a
stick of Hagoromo. Young mathematicians watch university surplus sales to try
and score a slate chalkboard at a hefty discount. The chalkboard is the
hearth of the mathematical community---where students and professors gather to
share ideas and prove new theorems.

I'm a sucker for tradition, so when I learned about this mathematical quirk
during my senior year of undergrad I went out and bought a cheap chalkboard and
a pack of Hagoromo. While I've never collaborated with anyone on this
chalkboard, it still hangs a few feet to the left of my desk. When I first
started writing on it, I knew that I was participating in a story that stretched
back through generations of math students. It brought me joy to think about a
potential future where I would work on problem sets in an office with my peers.

*** The Art of the Grad Office
**** The Dungeons of Building 38
I moved to San Luis Obispo in February 2021 and spent the first four months doing
classes online. The pandemic was in full swing and
I only stepped foot on campus a handful of times before in-person classes
resumed in September. I spent most of that spring and summer in my apartment
with the occasional trip back to Sacramento. When I started my second year I was
confronted with two disparate truths: I really liked my peers but I knew that
I was moving in less than a year. I'm too much of a romantic to pretend that I
wasn't going to make friends but that deadline loomed over SLO just like the
golden hills.

I quickly fell into a rhythm in SLO, with the weeks marked by Taco Tuesdays,
grading quizzes, and puzzling through Dr. Brussel's pathological problem sets.
Our offices were simple---roughly the square footage of a dorm room, four heavy
duty 8' tables topped with iMacs and ancient printers lined three of the walls
with a chalkboard across the fourth. While four people shared each
office, it was not uncommon for eight or ten to congregate in a single
office. This overcrowding led to us nicknaming the offices "the dungeons."
In our office, we moved all the computers to one
corner so that we could work on our laptops or spread out whatever books we
were referencing for our classes or research---this had the added bonus of
making room for an espresso machine, coffee grinder, and pour-over setup. Since
our classes were down the hall from the offices, it was not uncommon to get to
campus before sunrise and not emerge from the dungeons until after the sun had
set.

As quarters passed, we grew close and learned how to make the best of life in
the dungeons: Karl and I would drag each other into the sun for some much-needed
vitamin-D, Taco Tuesdays went later and later as friends became family, we
enrolled in a bowling class and spent two hours a week bowling poorly,[fn:1] I
befriended a few students outside of the major and spend time not thinking about math.
And yet, one thing never changed: after class we would congregate around a
chalkboard in the "social" office and go over anything that confused us in the
lecture.

The chalkboard in my office in Cal Poly was old and pitted, but it was clearly
well loved. Over the 21-22 academic year we put over a hundred sticks
worth of chalk on that board; some of it was Prang (the brand provided by the
department) but most of it was Hagoromo. Sometimes a week would go by without
facing a problem that was so difficult it required chalkboard work---when this
happened the boards would collect doodles from some of the art students who were
friends of the department.
But then, when the problem sets were particularly pathological, we gathered
around a chalkboard and worked through problems together.  While it was the
adventures off campus that made us family, we were always at home around a chalkboard.

**** The Carrels of Cupples I
Imagine my surprise, then, when I first walked into the basement of the Math
Department at Wash U and saw the first-year offices. Over twenty carrels filled
a room not much bigger than my office in SLO.
Cold CFL's in a colder, hanging industrial frame washed out the
little bit of natural light coming from the tiny windows near the ceiling.
I would come to find out that
there was a bit of drama surrounding office placements. As you move through
the program, you change offices. You are still confined to a carrel, but the
square footage of the office itself increases. Perhaps most importantly,
however, the offices move to higher floors and have larger windows. This year
the previous fourth years didn't move into the fifth year
offices---meaning that none of the other years could move up. As result, the
first and second years are all stuck in a single office. The department added
more carrels in the middle of room so every student had their own desk,  but the
resulting office is a maze of desks, most of which sit empty because many
of the other students (understandably) want to study elsewhere.

The first-year offices only has a single chalkboard; it's three feet wide and
sits on a wobbly wooden stand. Even when cleaned, it still looks a little dusty.
On the chalk ledge sits half a stick of white Crayola (which writes a little
worse than Prang) and a nub of sidewalk chalk.[fn:2] It's a perfectly functional
chalkboard, but it's hard to love. Compared to Cal Poly (where the grad offices
were built around the chalkboard) the board here feels like a bit of an afterthought.

Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful that the department gave us offices---many
graduate students don't get an office until they pass their qualifying exams.
Comparison may be the thief of joy, but I can't help it. The labyrinthine spread
of carrels feels more like a dungeon than anything in Cal Poly ever did. The
chalkboard, the supposed "hearth" of the mathematical community is relegated to
the only corner they couldn't fit a desk. At the end of the day, it isn't the
kind of office you invite a curious undergraduate into so you can explain the
nuances of the first isomorphism theorem.

*** The Trouble with Change
At this point in my life, I'm no stranger to moving to a new city. While I lived
in the same house from birth to graduating high school, I just had my third
"first week of college." When you start undergrad, everything feels like a
whirlwind; you're on your own for the first time, no one is going to tell you
when to go to bed or what to eat, and everyone around you is experiencing the
same new-found freedom. Every September, the spirit of Bacchus descends upon
college campuses and first-years everywhere are overtaken. Looking back on it,
it feels almost otherworldly. I am an introvert to my core and yet I was
attending event after event meeting new people left and right. It seemed like
that was just what you did at the beginning of college.

The transition into my masters was different. Sure, COVID made in-person events
complicated but even when transmission rates were down and restrictions loosened
there was a decided lack of the bacchan revelries that marked the beginning of
undergrad. Not only were we all in our early 20s, over half of my cohort were
"4+1 students" who did their undergraduate studies at Cal Poly---meaning they
were already close friends. When I started my masters, I didn't feel like I had
to rush to make friends. The relationships grew slower, but more organically.
Even with a deadline on the horizon, classmates naturally became friends, and
friends became family.

Now I'm here in Saint Louis making this transition a third time. While it's
going as I expected---slowly growing closer with my cohort, working on problem
sets together and planning the occasion trip---I can't help but compare Wash U
to Cal Poly. The transition to my masters was so distinct from that to my
undergrad that comparing the two didn't feel appropriate. With Wash U, on the
other hand, it feels almost identical. The people here are lovely. I can see
many of them becoming life-long friends and collaborators. I can't help but
thinking, however, that I don't want a new circle. The people I had in SLO were
amazing; they were family. I know that making the comparison will only make the
adjustment period longer but I can't help it.

The fundamental problem here is bound in time. Strangers can't (or perhaps
shouldn't) become close friends overnight. To become close with my
new cohort I need to lean in---just as I did a year ago. Commit to the new friends
and let time run its course.

When I sat down to write, I hoped I would discover something about the nature of
change, to find the beginnings of an answer as to what it all means. On the other
side of a few hundred words, I think it's a question wrongly put. Trying to
understand what change means is like trying to understand the ocean---maybe
someone understands it, but I certainly don't.

The only thing that I can do is be present. So I guess that's what I will do. I
will work on the problem sets with my classmates and hope that it's
not a fluke that generations of graduate students have become family following
the same pattern. It may not be perfect, but that little, dusty-green chalkboard
on the wobbly stand just might be the saving grace for that harshly lit basement
office.

bowling...  who would have guessed.
