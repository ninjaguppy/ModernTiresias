# I Think I Liked My Masters Better


I'm only three weeks into my PhD and something is gnawing at me: I think I liked
doing my masters better.

There's an undergraduate in the graduate algebra class who seems to be in a bit
over his head. While lectures don't assume any previous knowledge of algebra,
they move very quickly if it's your first time seeing the ideas---what an
undergraduate course would cover in the span of 10-12 weeks we are doing in
four. Late last week, he asked the professor a question that was born out of a
misunderstanding of a fundamental concept, and I could tell that he wasn't quite
satisfied with the answer. By habit I leaned forward to whisper something along
the lines of "If you want, stop by the grad offices after class and I can
explain" but I stopped myself.  At Cal Poly (where I did my masters) we always
joked that we were packed into the grad offices like sardines but the offices at
Wash U are practically overflowing.

When I met with my one of my academic advisors prior to the start of the
semester, I asked about what the office situation was. After chuckling he told
me that first years each given a carrel but assured me that the accommodations
got better as you progressed through the program.
