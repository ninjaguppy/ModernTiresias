During my undergraduate degree I had lots of space to write. While I love spending my days thinking about sheaves, analytic functions, and cohomology, I wanted a place to get the thoughts out of my head and onto a page. If all goes well, there should be a post here every Sunday on whatever thoughts have wedged themselves into the caffeine-addled brain of a graduate student preparing for qualifying exams. I tend to think about memory, narrative, beauty, among other things, but the last thing I want to do is put my work here in a box. I make no promises about the quality of the posts here—this is a space primarily for me to process my own thoughts—but if you’re interested in what I have to say, please follow along!

There’s an undergraduate in the graduate algebra class who seems to be in a bit over his head. While lectures don’t assume any previous knowledge of algebra, they move very quickly if it’s your first time seeing the ideas—what an undergraduate course would cover in the span of 10-12 weeks we are doing in four. Late last week, he asked the professor a question that was born out of a misunderstanding of a fundamental concept, and I could tell that he wasn’t quite satisfied with the answer. By habit I leaned forward to whisper something along the lines of “If you want, stop by the grad offices after class and I can explain” but I stopped myself. At Cal Poly (where I did my masters) we always joked that we were packed into the grad offices like sardines but the offices at Wash U are practically overflowing. When I met with my one of my academic advisors prior to the start of the semester, I asked about what the office situation was. After chuckling he told me that first years each given a carrel but assured me that the accommodations got better as you progressed through the program.
