This is the first part in a three(ish) part series about narrative---while I would love to
write one long piece with all of the ideas, the outline became too sprawling to
write in one week. I make no claims of expertise, these are just the thought of
one mathematician with a heart for the liberal arts. Part one discusses my own
relationship to storytelling
and contains mild spoilers for _Everything Everywhere All At Once_.

When I was 13 my grandfather and I went to Australia. Our group spent a few days
on K'gari (also known as Fraser Island)---our guide was an aboriginal man whose
family had lived on the island for generations. All of the electricity on
K'gari Island turns off at shortly after sunset, so light pollution is virtually
nonexistent at night. On the last night we spent on
K'gari, we sat around a fire and he told us stories from their mythology:
their creation narrative, the stories of past heroes, and the history and myths
surrounding the didgeridoo. Unsurprisingly, there were stories about the figures
they found in the constellations. On K'gari, however, there are portions of the
sky that are so dense with stars that the locals would create constellations out
of the negative space in the sky. I remember being fascinated by the stories. At
one point I stepped away from the fire and laid on the ground to get a better
look at the stars. I can't claim that I was somehow sucked into the
narrative and saw the heroes dancing among the stars. There was no "fantastical
imagery" conjugate in my mind; all I saw were the stars,
but I know that I experienced something special that night.  I already had a soft
spot for the art of storytelling, but listing to those stories passed down
through generations convinced me that there is something a little bit magical
about storytelling.


## The Human Experience {#the-human-experience}

I'm not going to pretend that I have some sort of "extra-special knowledge" when
it comes to the history of storytelling, but I do know this: storytelling is
central to the human experience. I can't cite a study but I know deep in my
bones---the same way I know how to raise my arm or know what an apple looks
like---that humans have always been telling stories. Storytelling, of course,
serves an evolutionary purpose. Stories can be used to spread life-saving
information through a population group. To reduce storytelling to an
evolutionary mechanism, however, is like reducing man to a featherless biped.
When someone tells you a story, they invite you to share an experience. The
beauty of storytelling is evident; it's something that humans have done for
millennia: gather around the campfire and weave epic tales of good and evil---or
sometimes just the epic tale of what they did that day.

It's partially this communal aspect that draws me to narrative.
One summer in high school I found myself in a movie theater watching an animated
movie that was entirely in Spanish. One of my friends has cracked her phone
screen so a group of us spent the afternoon at the mall while it was getting
repaired. We window shopped for a while but when we still had two hours to kill
by the time we exhausted the offerings. When we wandered over to the attached
movie theater we say they were playing _Un Gallo con Mucho Huevos_ in ten minutes
and immediately bought tickets. Thankfully there were English subtitle but, as
far as I could tell, we were the only people in the packed theater that didn't
speak Spanish.

The next 98 minutes felt a bit like a fever dream. Occasionally, the subtitles
would give away a joke a few seconds before it would be spoken on screen. This
meant that  my friends and I would laugh a few seconds earlier that the rest of
the theater. I don't remember any of the plot (aside from a satirical character
named "Snoop Duck") but I do remember how it felt to be in that theater. I was
with people that I loved watching a movie on a random Saturday afternoon. Sure,
some of the jokes didn't translate into the subtitles and we sat there silently
while the theater erupted in laughter around us. It didn't matter that sometimes
the jokes would hit differently and would we would laugh at the wrong time. When
we laughed, it was a thing we did together---sometimes just the three of us but,
when we were lucky, it was the entire theater.
The plot of the movie, it turns out, was insignificant in light of the experience
of the story.


### A Historical Perspective {#a-historical-perspective}

In the beginning of undergrad I spent so much time waxing poetic about the
importance of narrative that in my second year I decided to write a paper about
it. Titled "Dress Like It's Fall and It Will Become Fall," it explored the ways
in which a society is shaped by its cultural mythos. I won't get into the
details of the full argument, but the central idea was that the stories we tell
ourselves shape the way we see the world. While it may be blatant propaganda,
Virgil's _Aeneid_ tells us what it meant to be a "good Roman" in the early Roman
Empire. Its particular picture of piety tied together filial, religious, and
patriotic devotion.
The epic's hero, Aeneas (who founds modern Rome in the final chapter) has many
not-so-subtle parallels to the then newly crowned Augustus; Virgil seems to be
telling us, "You know how we all revere Aeneas for his piety? We should do the
same thing with Augustus. After all, just like Aeneas was the last hope for
Troy after the city's fall Augustus has saved us from the turmoil of the past
decades."
For generations after its composure, Romans looked to _The Aeneid_ for
guidance---over two thousand year later we still read it to gain insight into the
Roman mind.

_The Aeneid_ is not a one-off example! In fact, it isn't even confined to epic
poetry. I won't go so far as to say that _every_ narrative has some "deeper
meaning" that it is trying convey,[^fn:1] but for the vast majority of stories, it's
safe to assume they have something to teach you. Whether or not the things they
have to say are worth listening to, however, is another question entirely.
This link between thematic ideas and narrative is why I'm such a big proponent
of the Liberal Arts. When done right, it exposes us to some of the best pieces
of literature and teaches us to engage critically with the world around us.

After my sophomore year, I solidified many of my thoughts surrounding
storytelling. I knew that my thoughts on storytelling would likely never stop evolving
but at least I had formalized my opinion on the place of a cultural mythos in society.


## Compulsive Storytelling {#compulsive-storytelling}

With my grandiose views what stories "mean," its no surprise that I love telling
them. I'm not sure if I'm any good at it,[^fn:2] but I definitely have lots of
practice. Storytelling is so woven into my being that I realized I tell
stories compulsively _while telling a story_.

Some coworkers and I were grabbing a coffee and pastries between setups during
Family Weekend at Biola. I started telling a story (sadly I can't remember what it was)
and one of the trainees stopped me.

"Wait," he said. "Does this have anything to
do with what we were talking before or are you changing the subject?"
I was a little embarrassed---I knew my story's relevance was tangential at best but it
stung to have that pointed out before it was halfway finished.

Thankfully, another coworker jumped to my rescue. "Don't worry," he said. "Lucas
has this super power where he starts a story that seems completely random but he
somehow always connects it back."

While what he said was kind, it set the bar of relevance a little too high for
what my story could deliver. Thankfully, he had given me another way out. "I
have this weird thing with storytelling," I said. "When I think of a story that
is related to topic of conversation it bounces around my head until I let it out
by telling the story."
This seemed to satiate my coworkers and we went back to discussing the next room
setup: what gear we needed to pick up, how fast the turn around was, etc. In
the back of my mind, however, I was turning over what I had just said.

You see, I
spent years justifying to myself why I didn't have OCD; I had all sorts of
rationalizations for why my experience was distinct. When I read _Turtles All
the Way Down_, a book which is, in part, about the author's experience of
OCD, I told a friend "I've never seen my own experience of mental illness so
thoroughly explored... but that's weird because I don't have OCD." During an
intake exam at a new therapist a few months later, I told the examiner "I have
obsessive thought patterns, but not in an OCD way because there aren't any
compulsions that go along with them."

After years of rationalization, there I was: seated outside a coffee shop with
my coworkers having described an obsessive thought pattern and a corresponding
compulsion.

This realization put my love of storytelling in context. It's not just that I
love storytelling in the abstract and liked to take on the mantle of
storyteller from time to time---I have no choice but to be a storyteller. When I
think of a story I obsess over it, turning over the details in my mind in the
hopes to arrive at some "local maximum" of quality. Because of my OCD, this
process will continue until I tell the story to the group.
As far as
my compulsions go, this is relatively harmless. With some therapy, I'm able
keep the stories in my head when the situation isn't appropriate. But at the end
of the day, I _like_ telling stories. I like what stories mean; how they bring
people together and draw them into community.

It turns out, however, that even this context was incomplete. For the final
piece of the puzzle we need to change the subject---but I promise that it will relate.


## The Apple {#the-apple}

I want you to look at the nearest flat surface and imagine an apple. Not some
platonic ideal of an apple, but pretend there is a real apple sitting there.
What color is it? Does it have a bruise? Is there a perfect little leaf on the
stem?
Now that you've got the picture in your mind, how would you rate your ability to
"see" the apple an a scale of 1-10 where 10 is "I know its made up, but I can practically see it"
and a 1 being "what are you even talking about, of course I can't see anything"?[^fn:3]

Most of the people I ask give an answer above 6 or 7; on a good day I'm a 1.
The concept of a "mind's eye" is totally foreign to me---until recently I
thought it was just a useful metaphor.
I have a condition known as aphantasia, which is sometimes colloquially known as
_mind blindness_. Put simply, there are no pictures in my head.
According to a recent study in the journal of Consciousness and
Cognition,[^fn:4] less than 1% of the population have full aphantasia and about 4%
have dim/vague mental imagery (if any at all).

There are some reports of so-called _acquired_ aphantasia (usually the result of
some sort of traumatic brain injury) but mine is congenital---I've had it my
whole life and never known anything else. Until November 2018 (just over a year
after the coffee shop story) I had no idea that I was different. When people
would say "picture a beach" I always thought was a way to say
"think about the ideas of peace and serenity." I figured it, like the piety of
Aeneas, was societal shorthand for a shared concept. Imagine my surprise, then,
when I learned that other people could just "see things" in their head!

Suppose I were to ask you to complete the lyrics, "Mary had a___________\_." Now
chances are, you were able to fill in _little lamb_ with thinking about it. It's
not like you had to picture Mary in their shepherd's outfit or imagine a sheet
of paper with the lyrics written on it---you just _knew_ the answer. That's what
all knowledge is for me! It's hard to describe it any further without leaning on
visual metaphor. For me, concepts float in a void of nothing, accessible as ideas, but
not as pictures.

Aphantasia affects my memory. The best way I can describe it is that I remember
_that_ things happened but don't remember them _happening_. I've known that my
memory was different since I was in high school. For a long time, it made me sad
that I couldn't remember things in the same way as my peers. To a degree, it
still does, but the context of aphantasia has helped me make my peace with it.

When I tell the story of a memory, however, everything changes. I still can't
"see" it but, for that brief moment, it goes from a list of things that happened
to something that, in some sense, _is happening_.
I can't give an accurate description of what its like to tell a story if you
don't have aphantasia, so maybe this is a universal experience. When I think
about a memory, it's like reading sheet music, but I tell that the story it's
like seeing an orchestra perform the same
piece---both contain the same information, but the story is alive in a way the
pure memory isn't. Just as every conductor has their own interpretation of a piece
every retelling is slightly different, shaped to the audience and context.

It's no wonder, then, that I love telling stories. This "magic power" they have
to transport us out of the present and into some third place is real---if only
real for me. When I hear into other people tell stories, I don't see the
stories unfold in front of me. Instead, they suck me in and I experience them
the same I experience memory. For me, stories and memories are hopelessly
entwined, each begetting the other in an eternal dance.
The stars above K'gari may not have "come alive" and shown me the heroes of old
but that night something magical happened. Words decay into imprecision when I
try to explain it---they strain, crack, and break under the tension imparted by
experience. Perhaps my love of storytelling is looking to that moment and trying
to recreate it. Perhaps its a consequence of my brain chemistry, a obsessive
thought that needs to be freed or a memory made alive again. Each of these still
feel like a featherless biped, reducing something vast and intricate into a tidy
little box. The beauty of storytelling may be evident, but its nature is
something elusive; a word whispered from the brambles asking us to listen and
follow.

I recommend keeping up with the blog via RSS, but I know that not everyone
uses it (if you've never used it before it's a good way to keep up with
blogs/forums anywhere on the internet). That said, it you would prefer to

[^fn:1]: I'm sure there are counter examples of "stories that have no deeper
    meaning" but these are few and far between and I can't think of any off the top
    of my head.
[^fn:2]: Its one of the things where it's hard to trust the answers you get to the
    question of "Am I good at this." They're probably telling the truth, but you
    will never know.
[^fn:3]: For further scale calibration, some people say that they can
    "superimpose" the apple into reality---I think that falls somewhere in the 7-8
    range. I wish I could help with calibrating this part of the scale but to me the
    apple is completely made up and has no visual component.
