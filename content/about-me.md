I am a first year PhD student at Washington University in Saint Louis. During my
undergraduate degree I had lots of space to write. While I love spending my days
thinking about sheaves, analytic functions, and cohomology, I wanted a place to
get the thoughts out of my head and onto a page.


If all goes well, there should be a post here every Sunday on whatever thoughts
have wedged themselves into the caffeine-addled brain of a graduate student
preparing for qualifying exams. I tend to think about memory, narrative, beauty,
among other things, but the last thing I want to do is put my work here in a
box. I make no promises about the quality of the posts here---this is a space
primarily for me to process my own thoughts---but if you're interested in what I
have to say, please follow along!
